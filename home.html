                <p>I have always been that tech guy to the people around me, whether a technical issue or a suggestion to buy new e-devices.</p>

                <p>It has been quite a journey, from `being an audience to the tricks being performed by the computers` to `me becoming the magician behind those tricks`.
                
                Today, not only am I the tech guy who knows about technical devices and resolves issues but also a budding software technologist (You never know everything). A few of my contributions to the tech industry include building APIGateways and building efficient and optimized disaster recovery tools to handle the ACID properties of data.</p>
                
                <p>I go by two philosophies, `You never know everything, there's always room for new things` and `Don't rely on a particular technology, rather grow the ability to learn and adapt to new ones`.</p>
                
                <p>I am now a dedicated and versatile professional in the field of Computer Science, holding a Master's from the University of Massachusetts - Boston and a Bachelor's from Anna University. With a strong foundation in software engineering, I have cultivated a diverse skill set spanning various technologies, methodologies, and frameworks.</p>
                
                <p>With a comprehensive skill set and a passion for technological innovation, I am a proactive and versatile professional ready to contribute effectively in software engineering and technology-driven roles.</p>
